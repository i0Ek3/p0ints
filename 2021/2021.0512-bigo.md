# bigO

bigO means to calculate the time complexity and space complexity of a code, which written by Go.

The method of calculation is to set up a markup and statitic the count of computation loop in code.

Something about time complexity and space complexity we can check [here](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/LWBfehW1gMuEnXtQjJo-sw) and [here](https://github.com/youngyangyang04/leetcode-master/blob/master/problems/%E5%89%8D%E5%BA%8F/%E5%85%B3%E4%BA%8E%E7%A9%BA%E9%97%B4%E5%A4%8D%E6%9D%82%E5%BA%A6%EF%BC%8C%E5%8F%AF%E8%83%BD%E6%9C%89%E5%87%A0%E4%B8%AA%E7%96%91%E9%97%AE%EF%BC%9F.md).

Other thoughts wait to post later, bigO WIP.
